  Pure Elixir HTTP/2 implementation

  This library provides HTTP/2 connection management and frame (de)serialization
  facilities. The aim is to provide a solid foundation upon which clients and
  eventually servers can be implemented providing higher layer features.

  Ankh only supports HTTP/2 over TLS. Support for HTTP/2 over plaintext
  TCP was intentionally left out.
